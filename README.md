# reaction-app

An application built throughout a Udemy course - Node With React: Fullstack Web Development. In this app the user creates a simple survey about their business or product. After completion of a survey, the app handles emails to the list of provided recipients. Then with click tracking via SendGrid, the survey responses are recorded so the user can see the overall reaction to their survey.
